# linkedList
Super basic linked list. My first time writing up a data structure from scratch (list.c).  
  
## Current Updates: 
* seperated files for each function and 1 master file with all functions included (singlyLinked.c)  
* better comments and explanation
#### singlyLinkedList.c:  
* New file (singlyLinkedlist.c) includes updates and more advanced implementation of linked lists using functions and strings.  
* added removeNode()
* added printList()
* added prependNode()
* added allocNode()
* added appendNode()
* added to sepperate insertion functions
* added reverseList()
* added middleList()
* added comments explaining every line in main()
* added comments explaining every function
* Linked list manipulation  
#### reverseList.c:  
* added reverseList()
* comments explaining every line in main()
* comments explaining every function  
#### middleList.c:  
* added four implementations of finding and returning middle node
* added timer to clock the speed of each implementation of middleList.c
* comments explaining every line in main()
* comments explaining every function  
### ***More updates coming soon to this repository:*** ###  
* planning on uploading multiple implementations of this data structure in the future in different languages as I learn them
* format fixes coming soon...
  
### Current Languages Implemented:
