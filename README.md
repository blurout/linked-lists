# linkedList
Super basic linked list. My first time writing up a data structure from scratch (list.c).  
  
## Current Updates: 
#### singlyLinkedList.c:  
* New file (singlyLinkedlist.c) includes updates and more advanced implementation of linked lists using functions and strings.  
* added removeNode()
* added reverseList()
* added printList()
* added prependNode()
* added four implementations of middleNode() (this will become a sepperate file in the future)
* added comments explaining every line in main()
* added comments explaining every function
* added timer to clock the speed of each implementation of middleNode()

### ***More updates coming soon to this repository:*** ###  
* Planning on uploading multiple implementations of this data structure in the future in different languages as I learn them.  
* Better comments and explanation coming soon...
* Linked list manipulation.
* Format fixes coming soon...
* Seperate files for each function and 1 master file with all functions included
