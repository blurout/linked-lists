# linkedList
Super basic linked list. My first time writing up a data structure from scratch (list.c).  
  
## Current Updates: 
* seperated files for each function and 1 master file with all functions included (singlyLinkedList.c)  
* better comments and explanation  
## C:    
##### singlyLinkedList.c:  
* New file (singlyLinkedlist.c) includes updates and more advanced implementation of linked lists using functions and strings.  
* added removeNode()
* added printList()
* added prependNode()
* added allocNode()
* added appendNode()
* added to sepperate insertion functions
* added reverseList()
* added middleList()
* added comments explaining every line in main()
* added comments explaining every function
* Linked list manipulation   
* added deleteMiddle()
* added sortList()
##### sort.c:
* Coming Soon...
##### conversion.c:   
* converts binary number in a linked list to decimal 
* converts decimal number in a linked list to binary
* added dec2bi()  
##### reverseList.c:  
* added reverseList()
* comments explaining every line in main()
* comments explaining every function  
##### reverseKGroup.c:  
* coming soon...
##### middleList.c:  
* added four implementations of finding and returning middle node
* added timer to clock the speed of each implementation of middleList.c
* comments explaining every line in main()
* comments explaining every function  
##### list.c:
* my first time writing a linked list
## GO:
##### list.go:
* simple linked list in GO
## ***More updates coming soon to this repository:*** ###  
* implementations in different languages
* format fixes
* multiple sort algorithms
* comment fixes 
* translate C files to GO
* reverseKGroup.c (leetcode question)
## Current Languages Implemented:   
* C Programming Language  
* GO
